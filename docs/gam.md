## Definition
Generalized additive model (GAM) is a subset of generalized linear model (GLM) that links the reponse variable to a linear combination of smooth functions of the predictors with a link function.

$$
g(E(y_i)) = \beta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{N} f_n(x_{n,i})
$$

$g(.)$ is link function, $y_i$ is response variable, $x_{n,i}$ is predictor, $f_n(.)$ is smooth function.

### Spline function
Common choices of smooth functions are spline functions, such as B-splines, cubic splines, thin plate regression splines, and penalized splines. See more options [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf#Rfn.smooth.terms). Because B-spline is the simpliest spline function and has been commonly used, we use B-spline as an example. Assume $f_1$ is a B-spline over different intervals, connected by $K$ "knots", it is composed by a collection of B-spline basis function $B_{k,p}(t)$.

$$
f_n(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K}\alpha_kB_{k,p}(t)
$$

#### B-spline basis function
B-spline basis function is a piecewise polynomial and is defined by the order of degree $p$ and knots $K$. When $p=0$,

$$
B_{k,0}(t) = \begin{cases}
1  &t_{k} â‰¤ t < t_{k+1}\\
0 &otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

B-spline basis function with higher order of degree is calculated by $B_{k,0}$ through [Cox-de Boor formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline#Properties):

$$
B_{k,p}(t) = \frac{t-t_k}{t_{k+p}-t_k}B_{k,p-1}(t) + \frac{t_{k+p+1}-t}{t_{k+p+1}-t_{k+1}}B_{k+1,p-1}(t)
$$

For a B-spline basis function that has the support between $t_k$ and $t_{k+1}$, it sums up to 1. This is one of the properties of B-spline called partition of unity. It offers convenience and flexibility in estimation.

$$
\sum_{t_{k}=0}^{t_{k+1}}B_k = 1
$$

#### B-spline
Given the number of knots or the location of knots, and the degree of basis function, B-spline can be generated as a combination of B-spline basis functions using software package under the rules:

1. Repetitive knot location at the beginning and end of $t$ with number of knots = $p + 1$
2. Expect the number of basis functions to be: $K-p-1$
3. Each basis function sums up to 1 in their local support.

For example, to generate a B-spline function with 10 knots on a range of $[0,100]$, one would start with setting up the locations of knots, a common way is to setting them up uniformly as $[0,0,0,20,40,60,80,100,100,100]$. Then the number of basis function is $10 - 2 - 1 = 7$, with the support of each basis are respectively: $[0.20), [0,40),[0,60),[20,80),[40,100),[60,100),[80,100)$. Their function form can be derived using Cox-de Boor formula. Thus, we have a B-spline function as:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{7}\alpha_kB_{k,2}(t)
$$

Then the coefficients $\alpha_k$ for each basis function can be estimated given the data.

### Degree of freedom
Degree of freedom equals to the number of coefficients to estimate. In the case of spline function, it equals to $K-p-1$. This is an important measure to monitor the overfitting of spline function in estimation.

## Estimation parameters in GAM

In terms of likelihood function, there are two ways to estimate the parameters in GAM, frequentist-based and Bayesian-based likelihood.

### Frequentist-based likelihood
This has been applied by `mgcv` package in R and `pyGAM` in python. `mgcv` is able to not only estimate the coefficients of spline functions, but also choose the number of knots and order of degree of spline function using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). To guarantee model identifibility, it imposes the rule that the smooth functions will sum to zero over the range of predictor:

$$
\sum_{i}f(x_i) = 0
$$

See details [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/mgcv/man/identifiability.html)

Here, we use `mgcv` on our vaccine uptake data.

### R: mgcv

Model formula: `gam(y~x0 + s(x1),family, method, data)`.

* `gam()` is to fit GAM model given response variable `y` and predictors `x0` and `x1`
* `s()` models the smooth functions, with input of choices of spline functions, order of penalty, grouping factors, etc. To include grouping factors, use `bs = "re"`, indicating random effects.
* `family`: distribution and link function used in fitting.
* `method`: smoothing estimation method,`"REML"` is commonly-used.


#### simple GAM

Use national influenza vaccine uptake data an an example. We predict the vaccine uptake `estimate` using the days after vaccine roll-out. In this tutorial, we fixed the vaccine roll-out date to be July 1st every year.

Here, data is cleaned and splitted into training and testing, on July 1st, 2023.
```{r, results=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mgcv)

### national flu data ###
nis <- read.csv("../data/nis_flu_national.csv")
head(nis)
nis$time_end = as.Date(nis$time_end)

nis %>%
  mutate(time_end=as.Date(time_end),
         season_start_year= gsub("(\\d{4})/\\d{4}","\\1",season)) %>%
  mutate(season_start=as.Date(paste0(season_start_year,"-07-01"))) %>%
  mutate(elapsed=as.numeric(time_end-season_start))%>%
  mutate(season=factor(season))%>%
  select(-season_start_year) -> nis

train_end <- as.Date("2023-07-01")

nis %>%
  filter(time_end < train_end) -> nis_train

nis %>%
  filter(time_end >= train_end) -> nis_test

```

Fit a GAM model with a grouping factor `"season"`

```{r, results=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
nis_gam <- gam(estimate ~ s(elapsed,bs="bs") + s(season,bs="re"),data=nis_train,method="REML")
```

Get the forecast for season 2023/2024.
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

nis_test$pred <- predict(nis_gam,type="response",newdata=nis_test)

```

Evaluate model fitting by comparing with training data.
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#### compare with train data ####
nis_train$fitted <- nis_gam$fitted.values

nis_train %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=elapsed,y=estimate)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=elapsed,y=fitted)) +
  facet_wrap(season~.) +
  theme_bw()
```
![nis_national_train](img/train_nis_national_flu.jpg)

Evaluate forecasting by comparing with testing data.
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
nis_test %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=elapsed,y=estimate)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=elapsed,y=pred))+
  facet_wrap(season~.) +
  theme_bw()
```
![nis_national_test](img/pred_nis_national_flu.jpg)

#### Restrospective evaluation

```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

### retrospective forecasting ###
retro_gam <- function(forecast_start,data) {
  train <- data %>%
    filter(time_end < forecast_start)
  test <- data %>%
    filter(time_end >= forecast_start)

  gam_fit <- gam(estimate ~ s(elapsed,bs="bs") +s(season,bs="re"),data=train, method="REML")
  test$pred <- predict(gam_fit,type="response",newdata=test)

  return(test)
}

forecast_starts <- seq(as.Date("2023-09-01"),as.Date("2024-04-01"),"1 month")

all_preds <- lapply(1:length(forecast_starts),function(x) {
  retro_gam(forecast_start = forecast_starts[x],data=nis)
})

names(all_preds) <- forecast_starts
all_pred_df <- plyr::ldply(all_preds)

ggplot(all_pred_df) +
  geom_point(aes(x=time_end,y=estimate)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=time_end,y=pred))+
  facet_wrap(.id~.) +
  theme_bw()
```
![nis_retro_forecast](img/retro_forecasting_nis_flu_national.jpg)

We can see GAM model captures the observed data well as forecasting through the entire season. If we evaluate using MSPE:

```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mspe <- function(data, pred) {
  mean((data-pred)^2)
}

retro_mspe <- sapply(1:length(all_preds),function(x) {
  mspe(all_preds[[x]]$estimate,all_preds[[x]]$pred)
})

mspe_df <- data.frame(date=forecast_starts,
                      mspe=retro_mspe)

mspe_df %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=date,y=mspe))+
  theme_bw()
```
![nis_retro_eval](img/mspe.jpg)

MSPE is also pretty small.

#### GAM with grouping factors

How about the model that include both season and state as grouping factors? The influenza vaccine uptake data by season and state is loaded. Here are the similar data cleaning and splitting data as training and testing:

```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nis_state <- read.csv("../data/nis_flu_states.csv")

nis_state %>%
  mutate(time_end=as.Date(time_end),
         season_start_year= gsub("(\\d{4})/\\d{4}","\\1",season)) %>%
  mutate(season_start=as.Date(paste0(season_start_year,"-07-01"))) %>%
  mutate(elapsed=as.numeric(time_end-season_start))%>%
  mutate(geography=factor(geography),season=factor(season))%>%
  select(-season_start_year) -> nis_state

nis_state %>%
  filter(time_end < train_end) -> nis_state_train

nis_state %>%
  filter(time_end >= train_end) -> nis_state_test

```

Fitting GAM model given the spline function is B-spline, and `"geography"` and `"season"` are random effects.
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nis_state_gam <- gam(estimate ~ s(elapsed,bs="bs") + s(geography, bs="re") +
                      s(season, bs="re"),
                  data=nis_state_train,method="REML")
```

Getting the in-sample comparison and out-of-sample forecasting:

```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nis_state_train$fitted <- nis_state_gam$fitted.values
nis_state_test$pred <- predict(nis_state_gam,newdata=nis_state_test,type="response")
```

Compare with training data:
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
ggplot(nis_state_train) +
  geom_point(aes(x=elapsed,y=estimate,color=season)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=elapsed,y=fitted))+
  facet_wrap(geography~.)+
  theme_bw()
```
![nis_state_train](img/nis_flu_state_fit.jpg)

Compare with testing data:
```{r,results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
ggplot(nis_state_test) +
  geom_point(aes(x=elapsed,y=estimate)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=elapsed,y=pred)) +
  facet_wrap(geography~.) +
  theme_bw()
```

Given the results from `mgcv`, GAM is a promising option to forecast vaccine uptake. Next step should be incorporating this framework into our package. This requires switching to Bayesian likelihood.
